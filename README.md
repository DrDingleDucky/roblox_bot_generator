## Instructions

### Python Version

This project was developed using Python 3.10.10.

### Install Driver

The generator depends on the Selenium Python library, which requires a browser driver. I used Google Chrome, so I will need a Chrome driver. You can find the latest Chrome drivers [here]( https://chromedriver.chromium.org). Note that the driver and browser versions must be the same.

Make sure to put your driver in the "driver" folder.

### Install Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies.

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### How To Use

'new pool_1.txt' - Create a new file to store accounts.

'gen 1 pool_1.txt - Generate accounts and store them in a file.

'lanch pool_1.txt' - Automatically log in to all accounts in a file.

'quit' - Quit the program.

### Things To Note

All funcaptas must be completed MANUALLY.
